## Description
It's a command-line application that helps us to dynamically generate a Readme file based on user inputs and choices.
   
## Installation
     For installation, type "npm i" so the dependencies get installed first and will get access to npm package, especially - inquirer. 

## Usage
 Clone repository on your local machine, install dependencies (npm i) - previous step's note and after you get npm packages installed run "node index.js", answer the prompts and the Readme file will be created.
